# SimpleDelayJuce
This is a super simple delay plugin project to learn about JUCE with.
It may form the basis of a tutorial when I try to sum up the learnings.

## To Run this:
This is just the Source directory of a JUCE project. 
- Use the Projucer to make a new project, selecting you IDE in the usual way.
- You will need to add the DSP module to the project in the Projucer.
- Replace the source directory with this

## Features:
- Stereo Delay with adjustable feedback, wet level and delay length

## TODOs:
- Show delay length in ms as well as samples, for tuning comb effects
- MIDI triggering of delay length based on note pitch
- Some sort of un-terrible UI
